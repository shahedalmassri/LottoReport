Lottery ticket tally and report

This program takes CSV files containing lottery tickets with multiple numbers, between 5 to 10 numbers per ticket.
It also takes the name of the lottery and the total cash prize pool

The first line in the file must be the winning ticket numbers.

It will calculate and report how many tickets matched exactly, they split the first place prize money. It will report how much each winner gets.
It will also report how many tickets matched with 1 number off (second place) and 2 numbers off of the winning ticket (third place).
